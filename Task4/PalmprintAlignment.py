    ### Trace the boundary of the holes between fingers.
    







    ### Calculate the center of gravity of the holes and decide the key points | k1, k2, and k3.









    ### Line up k1 and k3 to get the Y-axis of the palmprint coordination system and
    ### then  make  a  line  through  k2  and  perpendicular  to  Y-axis  to  determine  the
    ### origin of the palmprint coordination system.






    ### Rotate the image to place the Y-axis on the vertical direction
